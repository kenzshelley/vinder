I am not secretive. I don't have grand stories. Now that I think about it, I fell in love with Mathematics on those long walks with my parents as a child. Little kids get bored incredibly quickly, and I was no exception. Whenever we would go on walks I would pester my parents to give me math problems to think about. My mom would often get lazy and just tell me to do operations on the same two fractions. First addition, then subtraction, multiplication and division. I always associated math with being with those people who I am closest too, and I am happy to say that has continued in my college career.
